    <center><h4>Iceland is a Nordic country located in the North Atlantic Ocean, just off the coast of Europe. It has a population of over 300,000 residents, most of whom are ethnically Icelandic. Iceland is known primarily for its capital city, Reykjavík, and also it's vast geographical landscape and scenery.</h4></center>

<center><h1>History of Iceland</h1></center>
<center><p style="color: #19d4cd">Iceland has a vast and interesting history, having been formed <strong>20 million years ago</strong> from a series of volcanic eruptions near the mid-atlantic ridge. In terms of geology, this is <em>really</em> recent, but for us humans, Iceland was one of the last large islands to become inhabited. However, a lot has happened since it's colonization in <strong>874 AD</strong>. The first permanent settler in Iceland is usually considered to have been a Norwegian chieftain named Ingólfr Arnarson and his wife, Hallveig Fróðadóttir. After them, many <em>more</em> people decided to settle in Iceland, eventually over time growing to the <strong>360,390</strong> population it is in present-day.</p></center>

<br>

<center><p style="color: #a1a1a1">Historically, many events have occurred in Iceland. During the earlier days of settlement, Christianity was adopted as the country's primary religion. Immediately afterwards, an era commonly dubbed as the <strong>"Age of Starlungs" </strong> occurred. This was a period of conflict in which Iceland should be given up control to the King of Norway, <em>Hákon the Old</em>. This occurred in the <strong>13th century</strong>. However, the hardships didn't end with this conflict, as next up on the historic timeline was the <strong>Laki Eruption</strong>. <em>Nearly 9,000 citizens</em> died and 80% of the livestock was wiped out, inducing a famine that killed a quarter of the population. Iceland was fought over a lot during World War I and II and it wasn't until <strong>1944</strong> that Iceland became officially independent.</p></center>

<center><h1>Reykjavík</h1></center>
<center><p>The capital city of Iceland, Reykjavík, has a population of over 100,000 and is located in the southwestern region of the country. It is also the largest city within the country, containing nearly 60% of the total population. Reykjavik is the northernmost capital in the world also, making it unique, and adding to that uniqueness are the plentiful amount of attractions that it has to offer!

<center><h1>Kópavogur</h1></center>
<center><p>Kópavogur is the second largest municipality within the country, lying just south of the capital city, Reykjavík. It is home to nearly 37,000 residents and contains many interesting attractions, such as the tallest building located in Iceland, the Smáratorg Tower. It is also historically significant due to being well known for the 662 Kópavogur meeting, in which Iceland became incorporated with Denmark-Norway. According to Wikipedia, Kópavogur is also a super prominent site for Icelandic urban legends about the huldufólk, which are essentially what we think of as elves. Kópavogur has a variety of excitement to offer to it's visitors!</p></center>

<center><h1>Akureyri</h1></center>
<center><p>Akureyri is different from the previous two cities mentioned. Akureyri is a town located in northern Iceland and is the fifth largest municipality in the country (~19,000 residents), and has been given the nickname "Capital of North Iceland". It is an important fishing and port center. The town's ice-free harbour has played a significant role in its history.
